<h3>CST 311 : Intro to Computer Networks</h3>
	Survey of Telecomm and Data Comm Technology Fundamentals, Local Area Network, Wide Area Network, Internet and internetworking protocols including TCP/IP, network security and performance, emerging industry trends such as voice over the network and high speed networking. Designed as a foundation for students who wish to pursue more advanced network studies including certificate programs. Includes hands-on networking labs that incorporate Cisco CCNA lab components.<br/><br/>

	In this course, I gained knowledge of basic networking layers, protocols, security, and use of WireShark. Much like how assembly language helped me to understand how algorithms are interpreted at a lower level, learning about network stacks revealed the lower level ongoings of network communications. I especially interested in learning about how packets travel through the different protocols of each network layers. Of particular usefulness was information about UDP and TCP connections of the transport layer. When doing any sort of network communications in applications, I find that these two protocols are exposed to the programmer. While not in my main interest, I was also glad to learn about securing network traffic and the efforts to protect data, verify identities, and stop intrusions.<br><br>
