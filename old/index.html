							Helps students identify and articulate personal, professional, and social goals. Provides an integrated overview of the computer science and communication design majors and their requirements. Students develop a plan for their learning goals. Students learn writing, presentation, research and critical-thinking skills within the diversified fields of information technology and communication design. Students learn how to analyze, predict, and articulate trends in the academic and public service.<br/><br/>

                                <p><b>Rose Colored Glasses</b> is a function that gets an image file and sets the average value of a pixel to its green channel while maxmizing red and blue channels. This creates a magenta-scale image. This method is a bit unorthodox, but I prefer how this function demonstrates the RGB and CMY relation of light.</p>

                                <p><b>Make Negative</b> is a simple function that gets an image file and inverts the value of each color channel. This function is fairly straight-forward and demonstrates the range of values allowed per color channel.</p>

                                <p><b>Better Black and White</b> is a function that gets an image file and creates a black and white image using weighted values for each color channel. The image is not a true grey-scale image, but is visually accurate. The result has more contrast than simply averaging the values of each color channel.</p>

                                <p><b>Mirror Bottom</b> is a function that gets an image file and copys the bottom half of an image and mirrors the pixels to the top half. This function helps to demonstrate the importance of understanding how pixels are indexed. Notice that the output pixel's y value is shifted by one to account for the difference between the actual height and the pixel's vertical index value that starts at 0 and ends at height-1.</p>

                                <p><b>Shrink Picture</b> is a function that gets an image file and copies that image to a 50% smaller canvas. The picture is shrunken by sampling every other pixel. This function accounts for odd sized canvases by starting sampling at the pixel indexed at 1. <br />For example:<br /> If starting at index 0, a picture with a width of 9 pixels would convert to a 4 pixel wide image and sample 5 pixels: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. This causes an error because there are more pixels sampled than the width of the shruken image. <br />If starting at index 1, a picture with a width of 9 pixels would convert to a 4 pixel wide image and sample 4 pixels: 1, 3, 5, 7. The pixel at index 9 is omitted because python's range function will generate numbers up to the, but not including, the end of the range specified.</p>

                                <p><b>Line Drawing</b> is a function that gets an image file, converts the image to black and white, and compares adjacent pixels to find edges. A sensitivity variable allows for adjustment to other images. Images have varying contrasts, but I find anything between 0 and 16 is a good range for sensitivity. The resulting image should have areas of distinct lines, while keeping background noise to a minimum. Ultimately, this function has more use as a stippling filter rather than a line drawing effect filter. <br />Due to the limitations of the prompt, this function has difficulties in detecting vertical and horizontal edges because both right and bottom pixels must be highly contrasting in order to be detected. If I were to code this again, I would also check the pixel diagonally to the bottom right. For more accurate line drawing, I would also repreat the function in reverse, checking for the top left pixels, and then combining the two results.</p>
