<h3>CST 499 : Directed Group Capstone</h3>
	Students will work on a project in large groups (up to 5 students in each group), developing requirements specification, a solution plan followed by design and implementation of the solution. The problem statement for the projects will be selected by the faculty. Faculty will also play the role of a project manager directing the schedule and deliverables for these projects.<br/><br/>
	<b>Program Outcomes:</b><br/>
	For my Capstone project, I created an Esports-like game that can be played with low-end consumer grade hardware and slow internet speeds.<br>
	The game can be found on <a href="https://jatse.itch.io/dark-matter-run">Itch.io</a> and source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jatse/Capstone">Github</a>.<br><br>
