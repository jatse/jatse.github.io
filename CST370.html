<h3>CST 370 : Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h3>
	Students learn important data structures in computer science and acquire fundamental algorithm design techniques to get the efficient solutions to several computing problems from various disciplines. Topics include the analysis of algorithm efficiency, hash, heap, graph, tree, sorting and searching, brute force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy programming.<br/><br/>
	<b>Program Outcomes:</b><br/>
	In this course, I gained an understanding of different data structures, the advantage of one structure over another, and how to input, sort, and search through the different structures. The most important aspect that I have gained from this course is the knowledge of how to visualize these structures literally and some using graph representation such as adjacency matrices and adjacency lists. This knowledge is especially useful for traversing the structure mentally or with pencil and paper. Through this course, I have also gained a better understanding of Big-O notations and how to determine time efficiencies of the basic operations in algorithms. We were also taught how to determine the time efficiency of recursive algorithms using the Master Theorem.<br/><br/>
